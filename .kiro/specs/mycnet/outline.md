# Digital Mycelium Network: Project Outline

## What We're Building

The Digital Mycelium Network is a **fully decentralized, self-hosting distributed platform** that eliminates single points of failure while providing scalable infrastructure for containerized applications. Think of it as a "living network" that grows, adapts, and manages itself - inspired by the resilient, interconnected structure of fungal mycelium.

## Core Philosophy: Why This Approach?

### 1. **Self-Hosting Architecture: Minimal Core + Distributed Intelligence**

**What**: A tiny, lightweight core (40MB) bootstraps the network, then hands control to sophisticated management services running within the network itself.

**Why**: 
- **Minimal Updates**: Node operators rarely need to update local files
- **Network Intelligence**: The network manages itself using its own distributed processing power
- **Scalable Management**: Management capabilities grow with the network
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Smaller core means fewer vulnerabilities

**Alternative Rejected**: Traditional centralized management would create single points of failure and require constant node updates.

### 2. **K3s Choice: Lightweight Foundation**

**What**: We use K3s (not MicroK8s or full Kubernetes) as our container orchestration foundation.

**Why K3s**:
- **Ultra-lightweight**: 40MB vs 200MB+ for alternatives
- **Consumer Device Friendly**: Runs on Raspberry Pi, ARM devices, low-power hardware
- **Single Binary**: Easier to bundle and distribute
- **Fast Bootstrap**: 30-second startup vs 1-2 minutes for alternatives
- **Edge-Optimized**: Designed for exactly our use case

**Why NOT MicroK8s**: Despite more features, the 200MB footprint and snap dependencies conflict with our minimal core philosophy. We can add needed features as custom components.

**Custom K3s Build Strategy**: We fork and customize K3s itself, removing unused components (Flannel, Traefik, local-storage) and integrating our purpose-built networking, storage, and security components as first-class features rather than add-ons. This reduces footprint by ~15-20MB, improves startup time, and provides better integration.

### 3. **Fungal-Inspired Network Topology**

**What**: Three-tier node hierarchy mimicking fungal networks:
- **Sclerotia** (Full Nodes): Permanent backbone, like fungal survival structures
- **Rhizomorphs** (Semi-Nodes): Adaptive clients that can take on varying responsibilities
- **Hyphae** (Pure Clients): End-user connections, like fungal feeding structures

**Why This Hierarchy**:
- **Natural Resilience**: Fungal networks survive massive damage and adapt to conditions
- **Resource Efficiency**: Different roles for different capabilities
- **Organic Growth**: Network can grow and adapt based on available resources
- **Fault Tolerance**: Multiple redundant pathways, no single points of failure

**Alternative Rejected**: Traditional client-server or peer-to-peer models lack the adaptive resilience we need.

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### 4. **Multi-Tiered Discovery: The Spore System**

**What**: Dual-purpose, three-tier discovery system:
- **Master Spores**: Coordinate entire mycelium network system
- **Service Spores**: Coordinate specific service container distribution
- **Authority Hierarchy**: Primary Spore > Seed Spore > Latent Spore

**Why This Architecture**:
- **Clear Authority**: Primary Spore (consensus result) is always authoritative
- **Backup Resilience**: Seed Spores provide optional backup coordination
- **P2P Discovery**: Latent Spore enables peer-to-peer network discovery
- **Dual Coordination**: Separate systems for network vs service management
- **Validation-First Conflicts**: All spore types validate data before merging, with discard policies for invalid data
- **Split-Brain Prevention**: Differential uptime and processing logic for read-only decisions

**Spore Data Structure**:
- **Database-Like**: Structured entries with specific limits, not compression
- **Node Information**: Locations, health, trust, reputation, usage metrics
- **Activity Tracking**: Read/write entries, connection logs, uptime differentials
- **Entry Limits**: Maximum entries per data type (X Rhizomorph P2P entries, etc.)
- **Intermittency Handling**: Frequent connect/disconnect periods tagged and condensed
- **Timeframe Scoping**: All temporal data limited to configurable timeframes

**Validation and Conflict Resolution**:
- **Validate First**: Check spore data validity and tampering before merging
- **Authority Hierarchy**: Primary > Seed > Latent for conflict resolution
- **Seed Spore Unidirectional**: Not merged unless connections confirmed by handling nodes
- **Latent Spore Validation**: Checked against Primary Spore before merging
- **Connection Confirmation**: Verify node connections independently before including
- **Discard Policies**: Remove outdated, irrelevant, or tampered data
- **Fallback Strategy**: Use validated Latent Spore network when Primary/Seed unavailable
- **Differential Logic**: Nodes with less uptime/processing enter read-only mode

**Alternative Rejected**: Single-purpose or single-tier discovery would lack the flexibility needed for both network and service coordination.

### 5. **Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus Without Hardware**

**What**: Software-based trust system using redundant execution and commit-reveal protocols.

**Why Software-Only**:
- **Accessibility**: No specialized hardware (TPM) required
- **Consumer Device Compatibility**: Works on any device
- **Trust Through Consensus**: Multiple nodes validate operations
- **Slashing Mechanism**: Bad actors lose trust and get excluded

**How It Works**: Critical operations go to multiple nodes, they commit hashes first (preventing copying), then reveal results. Majority wins, dissenters get penalized.

### 6. **Network Identity and Isolation**

**What**: Each network has unique cryptographic identity preventing accidental cross-network communication.

**Why Essential**:
- **Corporate vs Personal**: Company networks stay separate from personal ones
- **Dev vs Production**: Development environments can't accidentally connect to production
- **Multi-Tenant**: Different organizations get completely isolated networks
- **Security Domains**: Different trust levels and policies per network

**Implementation**: Cryptographic isolation keys, network compatibility checking, optional bridging for controlled inter-network communication.

### 7. **Distributed Storage: Transparent but Powerful**

**What**: Applications see standard file systems, but data is automatically chunked, replicated, and distributed across nodes.

**Why This Approach**:
- **Application Agnostic**: Any containerized app works without modification
- **High Availability**: Data survives node failures seamlessly
- **Performance**: Parallel access from multiple nodes
- **Encryption**: Per-service configurable encryption

**Technology Choice**: Longhorn or Ceph RBD for proven distributed block storage, presented as standard filesystems.

### 8. **Service Management: Endophytes**

**What**: Containerized applications (called "Endophytes" - organisms living within other organisms) run with their own discovery and management.

**Why "Endophytes"**:
- **Biological Metaphor**: Services live within the network organism
- **Independent Discovery**: Each service can have its own Service Spore
- **Flexible Deployment**: Services can run on all nodes, specific nodes, or custom rules
- **Isolation**: Kubernetes Namespaces provide security boundaries

### 9. **Container System Architecture: Three Deployment Models**

**What**: Three distinct approaches for running applications, each optimized for different use cases and fault tolerance requirements.

**üçÑ Endomycetes (Native Distribution - Phase 1)**:
- Natively distributed containers using standard Kubernetes deployment patterns
- Applications designed with built-in decentralization (blockchain, distributed databases, P2P systems)
- Use Service Spores for coordination and discovery
- Simpler to implement - leverages existing Kubernetes capabilities
- **Implementation Priority**: Start here to prove network infrastructure

**üåø Endophytes (Distributed RAM VMs - Phase 2)**:
- VMs with active-passive RAM replication using Rhizomorphs as connection layer
- **Active-Backup Synchronization**: Primary VM runs locally, memory replicated to distributed backup nodes via Rhizomorphs
- **Adaptive Throttling**: Configurable curves balance primary performance vs replication consistency
- **Two-Phase Migration**: Planned migrations leverage existing replicated state for near-zero downtime
- **Rhizomorph Integration**: Semi-nodes provide parallel connections for high-speed memory transfer
- Any standard operating system or application works without modification

**üîÆ Future SSI (Single System Image - Phase 3+)**:
- **Gold Standard Goal**: Perfectly decentralized virtual machine with lock-step active-active fault tolerance
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Explore compatibility with existing applications using distributed chunks and redundancies
- **Dynamic OS**: Truly decentralized operating system capable of hosting typical Linux applications
- **Research Phase**: Investigate asynchronous processing paradigm compatibility with existing software

**Development Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Endomycetes with Service Spores and basic redundancy
- **Phase 2**: Endophytes with distributed RAM and Rhizomorph connections
- **Phase 3+**: Research and develop SSI with asynchronous processing
- **All Benefit**: From network-level spore discovery, identity isolation, and distributed storage

**Why This Approach**:
- **Incremental Complexity**: Each phase builds proven foundation before adding complexity
- **Universal Compatibility**: Eventually support any application through multiple deployment models
- **Research Integration**: SSI as separate research goal doesn't block practical implementation
- **Biological Accuracy**: Different organisms have different relationships with their hosts

**Alternative Rejected**: Attempting SSI first would delay practical distributed computing capabilities.

### 10. **Distributed RAM System with Rhizomorph Integration**

**What**: Active-passive RAM replication system using Rhizomorphs as connection layer for high-speed memory transfer.

**Architecture**:
- **Primary VM**: Runs locally with full performance, tracks dirty memory pages
- **Distributed Backup**: Memory replicated across multiple backup nodes via Rhizomorph connections
- **Rhizomorph Layer**: Semi-nodes provide parallel high-speed connections for memory transfer
- **Adaptive Control**: Configurable throttling prevents buffer overflow while maintaining performance

**Key Features**:
- **Rhizomorph Connections**: Leverage semi-nodes for parallel bandwidth aggregation and connection resilience
- **Active-Backup Sync**: Primary runs at full speed, passive replicas maintained through continuous replication
- **Adaptive Throttling**: Configurable curves (linear, exponential, custom) balance performance vs consistency
- **Emergency Modes**: Optional VM pause for guaranteed consistency vs best-effort page discarding
- **Two-Phase Migration**: Planned moves use convergence protocol leveraging existing replicated state
- **High/Low Latency**: Automatic optimization for WAN (larger buffers) and LAN (smaller buffers) scenarios

**Rhizomorph Benefits**:
- **Bandwidth Multiplication**: Multiple semi-node connections increase total transfer speed
- **Connection Resilience**: Failure of individual Rhizomorphs doesn't break replication
- **Network Utilization**: Distributes replication load across available semi-nodes
- **Scalable Performance**: More Rhizomorphs = higher replication bandwidth

**Technology Stack**: QEMU/KVM + KubeVirt + Custom sidecars + Rhizomorph connection management

**Alternative Rejected**: Single backup node creates bottleneck; traditional migration too slow for near-zero downtime.
