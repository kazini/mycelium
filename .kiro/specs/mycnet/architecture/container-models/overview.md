# Container Deployment Models

## Overview

The Digital Mycelium Network supports three distinct container deployment models, each optimized for different application types and fault tolerance requirements.

## Deployment Models

### Endomycetes (Native Distribution)
**Applications with built-in decentralization capabilities**

- **Technology**: Standard Kubernetes deployment patterns with Service Spores
- **Use Cases**: Blockchain nodes, distributed databases, P2P systems
- **Management**: Applications handle their own distribution, consensus, and coordination
- **Discovery**: Independent Service Spores for service-specific coordination
- **Implementation**: Phase 1 priority - leverages existing Kubernetes capabilities

### Endophytes (Distributed RAM VMs)
**Standard applications requiring high availability**

- **Technology**: VMs with active-passive RAM replication via Rhizomorph connections
- **Use Cases**: Legacy applications, full operating systems, traditional hosting
- **Management**: Network provides seamless failover and distributed state management
- **Innovation**: Rhizomorph connection layer for parallel bandwidth and resilience
- **Dynamic Loading**: VM management and distributed RAM components loaded on-demand
- **Implementation**: Phase 2 - requires distributed RAM system development

### Future SSI (Single System Image)
**Research goal for perfectly decentralized virtual machines**

- **Technology**: Lock-step active-active fault tolerance with asynchronous processing
- **Use Cases**: Applications requiring perfect fault tolerance
- **Management**: Truly decentralized OS capable of hosting typical Linux applications
- **Research**: Separate development track exploring asynchronous processing paradigms
- **Implementation**: Phase 3+ research goal that doesn't block practical implementation

## Selection Criteria

### Automatic Model Selection
The system analyzes application characteristics to recommend optimal deployment:

- **Native Decentralization**: Applications with built-in clustering → Endomycetes
- **High Availability Required**: Monolithic applications → Endophytes (loads VM components)
- **Standard Deployment**: Applications without special requirements → Standard Kubernetes
- **Perfect Fault Tolerance**: Research applications → Future SSI

### Dynamic Component Loading
Components are loaded on-demand based on deployment model requirements:

- **Endomycetes**: Minimal additional components (uses standard K3s)
- **Endophytes**: VM management and distributed RAM components loaded when VMs are deployed
- **Standard K3s**: No additional components required
- **Component Cleanup**: Unused components automatically unloaded and cleaned up

### Configuration Flexibility
- **Per-Service Configuration**: Each service can specify its preferred deployment model
- **Hybrid Deployments**: Mix different models within the same network
- **Migration Support**: Ability to migrate between deployment models
- **Performance Optimization**: Model selection based on performance requirements

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Endomycetes
- Prove network infrastructure with natively distributed applications
- Establish Service Spore system for independent service discovery
- Validate self-hosting architecture and spore discovery
- Build foundation for more advanced deployment models

### Phase 2: Endophytes
- Implement distributed RAM system with Rhizomorph integration
- Develop active-passive replication with adaptive throttling
- Enable seamless failover for standard applications
- Support legacy applications and full operating systems

### Phase 3+: SSI Research
- Explore asynchronous processing paradigms
- Investigate compatibility with existing applications
- Develop truly decentralized operating system concepts
- Research lock-step active-active fault tolerance
