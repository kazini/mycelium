# Error Handling and Fault Tolerance

## Overview

The Digital Mycelium Network implements comprehensive error handling and fault tolerance strategies to maintain operation during various failure scenarios while providing graceful degradation and automatic recovery.

## Fault Tolerance Strategies

### Network Partitions and Split-Brain Recovery

**Partition Handling**:
- Continue operation with available nodes using eventual consistency
- Maintain CRDT operations for deterministic state merging
- Automatic reconciliation of Global Database when partitions heal
- Spore synchronization across split sections during merge
- Node acquisition/loss tracking during partition periods

**Split-Brain Resolution**:
- Default strategy: terminate one split instance based on processing/data volume evaluation
- Optional per-service custom merge strategies for advanced use cases
- Service state comparison using processing metrics and data timestamps
- Automatic cleanup of terminated service instances

### Isolated Node Behavior

**Single Node Isolation**:
- Nodes losing network access enter read-only mode by default
- Attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
- Override mechanism for continuing operation after timeout
- Resource sufficiency evaluation before resuming full operation
- Dedicated node reappearance detection for resuming normal operation

**Sparse Network Resilience**:
- P2P Latent Spore and Master Seed Spore track offline node activity
- Last-write tolerance for negligible timestamp differences
- Offline node discovery and seed data merging
- Node pointer maintenance even for currently offline nodes
- Activity period detection to determine sync requirements vs independent operation

### Storage and Consensus Recovery

**Storage Resilience**:
- Seamless I/O redirection to available replicas
- Automatic re-replication to maintain redundancy
- Parallel chunk recovery from multiple sources
- Integrity checking and corruption detection
- Performance optimization during recovery

**Consensus Recovery**:
- Trust score penalties for non-participating nodes
- Automatic recovery when quorum is restored
- Byzantine fault tolerance with up to 1/3 failures
- Gradual trust restoration for recovered nodes
- Emergency procedures for majority node loss

## Error Types and Recovery Mechanisms

### Network Errors
- **Node Unreachable**: Automatic failover and connection retry
- **Network Partition**: Partition-aware operation with eventual consistency
- **Service Split**: Intelligent merge strategies based on activity metrics
- **Consensus Failure**: Quorum management and trust score adjustment

### Storage Errors
- **Replica Unavailable**: Automatic failover to available replicas
- **Data Corruption**: Integrity checking and automatic repair
- **Storage Full**: Automatic cleanup and rebalancing
- **Performance Degradation**: Load balancing and optimization

### Identity and Security Errors
- **Network Identity Mismatch**: Connection rejection and proper network routing
- **Incompatible Version**: Version negotiation and compatibility checking
- **Isolation Key Validation**: Cryptographic validation and access control
- **Trust Threshold Violation**: Node exclusion and gradual rehabilitation

## Recovery Procedures

### Automatic Recovery
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of all system components
- **Failure Detection**: Rapid detection of failures and anomalies
- **Automatic Restart**: Automatic restart of failed components

- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize performance under constrained conditions
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent resource allocation during degraded operation
- **User Communication**: Clear communication of system status to users
- **Recovery Planning**: Automatic planning for full service restoration

## Monitoring and Alerting
