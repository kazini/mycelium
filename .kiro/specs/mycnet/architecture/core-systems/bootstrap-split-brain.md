# Bootstrap and Split-Brain Resolution Architecture

## Overview

The Digital Mycelium Network implements a sophisticated bootstrap and split-brain resolution system based on spore authority hierarchy and distributed coordination mechanisms.

## Spore Authority Hierarchy

### Established Authority Hierarchy
**Primary Spore > Seed Spore > Latent Spore**

### Spore Types
- **Master Spores**: Coordinate the entire mycelium network system
- **Service Spores**: Coordinate specific service container distribution and connection

### Key Principles
- **Authority Hierarchy**: Primary Spore > Seed Spore > Latent Spore
- **Master Seed Spores**: Optional backup mechanisms for network coordination
- **Service Seed Spores**: Always stored in distributed database for service coordination
- **Primary Spore Authority**: Always authoritative (result of node consensus)
- **Consensus Validation**: Seed and Latent Spores checked for consensus validation
- **Conflict Resolution**: All spore types support data merging with size/scope limits
- **Dual Coordination**: Separate spore systems for network (Master) and services (Service)
- **Node Write Access**: Only nodes have write access to seed spores
- **Rhizomorph Capability**: All Rhizomorphs have toolkit for dynamic node promotion

## Spore Data Structure and Content

### Spore Data Architecture
Spores function as specialized databases with specific entry limits and structured content:

```rust
struct SporeData {
    // Core spore identification
    spore_type: SporeType,           // Master or Service spore
    network_identity: NetworkIdentity,
    
    // Node information with entry limits
    recent_node_locations: Vec<NodeLocation>,     // Limited to X entries
    node_health: HashMap<NodeId, HealthStatus>,
    node_trust: HashMap<NodeId, TrustScore>,
    node_reputation: HashMap<NodeId, ReputationScore>,
    node_usage: HashMap<NodeId, UsageMetrics>,
    
    // Activity tracking within configurable timeframe
    last_read_writes: HashMap<NodeId, ReadWriteEntry>,
    connection_disconnection_log: Vec<ConnectionEvent>,
    uptime_differentials: HashMap<NodeId, Duration>,
    processing_volumes: HashMap<NodeId, u64>,
    
    // P2P network entry points (limited entries)
    p2p_rhizomorph_entries: Vec<RhizomorphEntry>,  // Limited to X amount
    
    // Metadata
    timeframe_config: TimeframeConfig,
    last_update: Timestamp,
    signature: SporeSignature,
}
```

### Spore Content Principles
1. **Database-Like Structure**: Spores contain structured entries with specific thresholds
2. **Entry Limits**: Each data type has maximum entry counts (X Rhizomorph entries, etc.)
3. **Timeframe Scoping**: All temporal data limited to configurable timeframes
4. **Intermittency Handling**: Frequent connection/disconnection periods tagged and condensed
5. **Health/Trust Integration**: Connection patterns affect health and trust calculations

### Size Management Strategy
- **Entry Thresholds**: Each data type has maximum entry limits
- **Scope Limitation**: Data kept within relevant scope and timeframe
- **Intermittency Condensation**: Frequent events tagged rather than logged individually
- **No Compression**: Size managed through data structure limits, not compression algorithms

## Spore Validation and Conflict Resolution

### Core Validation Principle
Each node independently validates spore data against authoritative sources before merging, with different validation rules for different spore types.

### Refined Merging Strategy
1. **Validate First**: Check spore data validity before any merging
2. **Authority Hierarchy**: Primary > Seed > Latent for conflict resolution
3. **Seed Spore Unidirectional**: Only merge confirmed connections
4. **Latent Spore Validation**: Check against Primary Spore before merging
5. **Tampering Detection**: Discard suspicious or invalid data
6. **Connection Confirmation**: Verify node connections before including in spores
7. **Fallback to Latent**: When no Primary/Seed available, use validated Latent Spore network

## Bootstrap Process

### Network Formation
1. **Genesis Node**: First node creates network identity and Master Seed Spore
2. **Initial Spores**: Bootstrap Primary Spore with network identity and initial configuration
3. **Node Registration**: Subsequent nodes register through spore discovery and validation
4. **Trust Establishment**: Initial trust scores assigned based on bootstrap validation
5. **Service Initialization**: Service Spores created for initial network services

### Split-Brain Prevention
- **Authority Validation**: All nodes validate spore authority before accepting data
- **Network Identity Checking**: Cryptographic validation of network membership
- **Consensus Requirements**: Minimum consensus required for critical operations
- **Partition Detection**: Automatic detection of network partitions
- **Recovery Coordination**: Coordinated recovery when partitions heal

## Split-Brain Resolution

### Detection Mechanisms
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of node connectivity
- **Consensus Tracking**: Monitoring of consensus participation and results
- **Spore Synchronization**: Detection of conflicting spore data
- **Network Topology Analysis**: Analysis of network connectivity patterns

### Resolution Strategies
- **Activity-Based Resolution**: Prefer partition with higher processing/data volume
- **Timestamp Analysis**: Use activity timestamps for conflict resolution
- **Manual Override**: Administrative override for complex scenarios
- **Gradual Merge**: Careful merging of network state when partitions heal

### Recovery Procedures
- **State Synchronization**: Synchronization of network state across partitions
- **Service Reconciliation**: Reconciliation of service states and configurations
- **Trust Score Adjustment**: Adjustment of trust scores based on partition behavior
- **Network Healing**: Restoration of full network connectivity and consensus

This bootstrap and split-brain resolution system ensures reliable network formation and recovery while maintaining the integrity of the spore-based discovery system.
