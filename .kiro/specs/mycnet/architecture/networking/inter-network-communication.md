# Inter-Network Communication System

## Overview

The Digital Mycelium Network supports controlled communication between different networks, creating a "network of networks" ecosystem that enables geographic federation, network migration, and controlled cross-network collaboration.

## Network of Networks Architecture

### Inter-Network Communication Framework

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
struct InterNetworkPolicy {
    source_network: NetworkId,
    target_network: NetworkId,
    communication_level: CommunicationLevel,
    allowed_services: Vec<ServiceId>,
    authentication_requirements: AuthRequirements,
    data_sharing_policies: DataSharingPolicy,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
enum CommunicationLevel {
    Blocked,                    // No communication allowed
    Discovery,                  // Only network discovery and basic info
    ServiceAccess,              // Access to specific services
    DataSharing,                // Controlled data exchange
    FullBridge,                 // Nearly full network integration
    NetworkMigration,           // Temporary bridge for user migration
}

struct NetworkBridge {
    bridge_id: BridgeId,
    networks: (NetworkId, NetworkId),
    bridge_type: BridgeType,
    authentication: BridgeAuthentication,
    traffic_policies: Vec<TrafficPolicy>,
    monitoring: BridgeMonitoring,
}
```

## Multi-Network Discovery Enhancement

### Cross-Network Service Discovery

```rust
struct MultiNetworkSpore {
    primary_network: NetworkId,
    known_networks: HashMap<NetworkId, NetworkInfo>,
    bridge_endpoints: HashMap<NetworkId, Vec<BridgeEndpoint>>,
    cross_network_peers: Vec<CrossNetworkPeer>,
}

impl MultiNetworkSpore {
    async fn discover_cross_network_services(&self, target_network: NetworkId) -> Result<Vec<ServiceEndpoint>> {
        // Use client's multi-network participation for discovery
        let bridge_info = self.bridge_endpoints.get(&target_network)
            .ok_or(NetworkError::NoBridgeAvailable)?;
        
        // Authenticate with target network
        let auth_token = self.authenticate_with_network(&target_network).await?;
        
        // Discover available services through bridge
        let services = self.query_cross_network_services(&target_network, &auth_token).await?;
        
        Ok(services)
    }
    
    async fn facilitate_cross_network_discovery(&self, requesting_network: NetworkId) -> Result<Vec<NetworkInfo>> {
        // Clients participating in multiple networks can help networks discover each other
        let mut discoverable_networks = Vec::new();
        
        for (network_id, network_info) in &self.known_networks {
            if self.can_facilitate_discovery(&requesting_network, network_id).await? {
                discoverable_networks.push(network_info.clone());
            }
        }
        
        Ok(discoverable_networks)
    }
}
```

## Network-to-Network Authentication

### Authentication Framework

```rust
struct NetworkAuthenticator {
    network_identity: NetworkIdentity,
    trusted_networks: HashMap<NetworkId, TrustLevel>,
    authentication_protocols: Vec<AuthProtocol>,
}

impl NetworkAuthenticator {
    async fn authenticate_network(&self, remote_network: &NetworkIdentity) -> Result<AuthToken> {
        // Network-to-network connections are treated as authenticated client connections
        
        // 1. Verify network identity cryptographically
        self.verify_network_signature(&remote_network)?;
        
        // 2. Check if network is in trusted list
        let trust_level = self.trusted_networks.get(&remote_network.network_id)
            .ok_or(AuthError::NetworkNotTrusted)?;
        
        // 3. Perform mutual authentication challenge
        let challenge = self.create_auth_challenge().await?;
        let response = self.send_auth_challenge(&remote_network, challenge).await?;
        self.verify_auth_response(&challenge, &response)?;
        
        // 4. Generate time-limited auth token with appropriate access levels
        let token = self.generate_auth_token(&remote_network, trust_level).await?;
        
        Ok(token)
    }
}
```

## Use Cases for Inter-Network Communication

### 4. Network Migration and Scaling
- **Gradual Migration**: Gradual migration of services between networks
- **Capacity Scaling**: Temporary scaling using resources from other networks
- **Network Merging**: Controlled merging of separate networks
- **Split Networks**: Controlled splitting of large networks into smaller ones

## Bridge Types and Policies

    },
    MigrationBridge {
        migration_plan: MigrationPlan,
        temporary_duration: Duration,
    },

    policy_id: PolicyId,
    source_criteria: SourceCriteria,
    destination_criteria: DestinationCriteria,
    action: TrafficAction,
    monitoring: MonitoringConfig,

    Allow,
    Deny,
    RateLimit { requests_per_second: u32 },
    RequireApproval { approver_roles: Vec<Role> },
    LogAndAllow { log_level: LogLevel },
    Quarantine { review_required: bool },
}
```

## Security and Monitoring

## Implementation Considerations

- **Configuration Management**: Management of inter-network configurations

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Caching of frequently accessed cross-network data

- **Load Balancing**: Load balancing across multiple bridge connections
- **Bandwidth Management**: Efficient use of inter-network bandwidth

### Fault Tolerance
- **Bridge Redundancy**: Multiple bridge connections for fault tolerance
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatic failover between bridge connections
- **Partition Handling**: Handling of network partitions affecting bridges
- **Recovery Procedures**: Recovery procedures for failed bridge connections

This inter-network communication system enables the Digital Mycelium Network to participate in larger ecosystems while maintaining security, performance, and operational control.
