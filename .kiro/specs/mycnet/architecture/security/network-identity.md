# Network Identity and Isolation

## Overview

The Digital Mycelium Network supports multiple independent networks operating simultaneously without interference. Each network has a unique identity and isolation mechanisms to prevent accidental cross-network communication.

## Network Identity Components

### Core Identity Structure
- **Network ID**: Unique identifier for the network
- **Network Name**: Human-readable network name
- **Genesis Timestamp**: Network creation timestamp
- **Genesis Nodes**: Initial nodes that created the network
- **Isolation Key**: Cryptographic key for network isolation (32-byte key)
- **Compatibility Version**: Version for compatibility checking

### Network Configuration
- **Max Nodes**: Optional limit on network size
- **Consensus Threshold**: Required consensus percentage (default 67%)
- **Encryption Required**: Whether encryption is mandatory
- **Service Isolation Level**: Level of service isolation (Strict/Controlled/Permissive)
- **Bridge Policies**: Policies for inter-network communication

## Isolation Levels

### Strict Isolation
- No cross-network communication allowed
- Complete separation of all network functions
- Independent trust domains and consensus
- Separate storage and service namespaces

### Controlled Isolation
- Explicit bridge configuration required for communication
- Authenticated inter-network connections
- Controlled service sharing with specific permissions
- Trust mapping between networks

### Permissive Isolation
- Allow discovery but require authentication
- Automatic bridge establishment with proper credentials
- Shared services with access control
- Federated trust management

## Network Scenarios

### Corporate vs Personal Networks
- Different isolation keys prevent accidental joining
- Separate service registries and trust domains
- Independent encryption and access control policies
- Organizational boundary enforcement

### Development vs Production Environments
- Version compatibility checks prevent dev nodes joining production
- Separate genesis configurations and trust bootstrapping
- Isolated storage and service namespaces
- Environment-specific policies and configurations

### Geographic or Organizational Boundaries
- Network names and configurations reflect organizational structure
- Regional compliance and data sovereignty requirements
- Independent administrative domains
- Localized trust and consensus management

### Multi-Tenant Scenarios
- Each tenant gets isolated network identity
- Separate trust scoring and consensus participation
- Independent service deployment and resource allocation
- Tenant-specific security policies

## Network Discovery and Validation

### Discovery Process
1. **Network Announcement**: Nodes announce their network identity
2. **Compatibility Check**: Verify network compatibility and version
3. **Isolation Key Validation**: Cryptographic validation of network membership
4. **Trust Establishment**: Establish trust relationship if compatible
5. **Service Discovery**: Discover available services within the network

### Validation Mechanisms
- **Cryptographic Signatures**: All network communications signed and verified
- **Network Identity Verification**: Continuous verification of network identity
- **Isolation Key Rotation**: Periodic rotation of isolation keys for security
- **Compatibility Checking**: Version and feature compatibility validation
- **Trust Score Validation**: Validation of node trust scores and reputation

## Network Bridging

### Bridge Types
- **Read-Only Bridge**: Allow data reading from target network
- **Service Proxy Bridge**: Proxy specific services between networks
- **Full Bridge**: Bidirectional communication with full trust mapping

### Bridge Configuration
- **Source and Target Networks**: Networks to be bridged
- **Allowed Services**: Specific services that can be shared
- **Trust Mapping**: Mapping of trust scores between networks
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained access control for bridge operations
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Comprehensive monitoring of bridge activity

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Strong authentication for all bridge operations
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained authorization for cross-network access
- **Encryption**: All bridge communications encrypted
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all bridge activities
- **Intrusion Detection**: Detection of unauthorized bridge attempts

## Implementation

### Network Identity Management
- **Identity Creation**: Secure creation of network identities
- **Identity Storage**: Secure storage of network identity information
- **Identity Validation**: Continuous validation of network identity
- **Identity Updates**: Secure updates to network identity information
- **Identity Revocation**: Procedures for revoking compromised identities

### Isolation Enforcement
- **Spore Validation**: All spore data includes network identity verification
- **Connection Filtering**: Nodes reject connections from incompatible networks
- **Service Isolation**: Services can only discover and communicate within their network
- **Storage Separation**: Data replication respects network boundaries
- **Trust Domain Isolation**: Trust scores and consensus participation are network-scoped

This comprehensive network identity and isolation system ensures that multiple Digital Mycelium Networks can coexist securely while providing controlled inter-network communication when needed.
