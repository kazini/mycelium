# Mycelium Network: Reference Materials

This directory contains reference implementations, code examples, and architectural patterns developed during the design process. These materials serve as blueprints for the actual implementation.

## Directory Structure

- **`virtual-computer/`** - Virtual Distributed Computer architecture and implementation patterns
- **`isolation-models/`** - Endophyte isolation strategies and configuration examples
- **`synchronization/`** - Deterministic execution and state synchronization patterns
- **`networking/`** - Advanced networking and VPN configuration examples
- **`deployment/`** - Service deployment configurations and strategies

## Usage

These reference materials are:
- **Design blueprints** for implementation teams
- **Architecture patterns** for understanding system behavior
- **Configuration templates** for deployment scenarios
- **Code examples** showing key algorithms and data structures

## Status

These are **reference implementations** - not production code. They demonstrate the architectural concepts and serve as implementation guidance for the development phases.
