# Digital Mycelium Network - Potential Improvements

## Overview

This document tracks potential improvements identified for the Digital Mycelium Network design and architecture. These improvements are categorized by priority and implementation complexity.

## Development Philosophy

**Core Principle**: This project prioritizes conceptual development and theoretical architecture validation before implementation. All architectural decisions must be thoroughly evaluated and validated at the conceptual level to ensure theoretical soundness before proceeding to development and testing phases.

**Approach**: 
- **Conceptual First**: Complete theoretical architecture design and validation
- **Architecture Review**: Comprehensive evaluation of all system interactions and dependencies  
- **Implementation Planning**: Detailed implementation strategy based on validated architecture
- **Iterative Development**: Incremental implementation with continuous architectural validation
