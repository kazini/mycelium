# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Digital Mycelium Network is a fully decentralized, self-hosting distributed platform built on K3s that eliminates single points of failure through a minimal core architecture and distributed management services. The system supports three container deployment models: Endomycetes (natively distributed containers), Endophytes (VMs with distributed RAM replication), and future SSI (Single System Image) research.

The platform implements a three-tier node hierarchy: (Dedicated/Dynamic Sclerotia full nodes, Rhizomorphs semi-nodes, Hyphae clients) with multi-tiered discovery (Primary/Seed/Latent Spores), Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus, and distributed storage. The system prioritizes AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance) with eventual consistency, scales from single consumer devices to large networks, and automatically optimizes based on network conditions.
