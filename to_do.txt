Personal to_do:

- Fix StackOverflow execution of shell commands issue in Kuro.
- Make sure gemini can read the folder and work on it within similar parameters.
- test and see how Gemini handles this, and how Cursor does, too
- Establish versioning git system and practices.




> Evaluate which system is better at different stages of development.
> Try to configure a hybrid approach with MCP in Cursor or Kuro with Gemini
